From the knowledge graph, we see that the Dzungars are mentioned as conquerors, but their relationship with Tibet is not directly relevant to the question. However, we do see that the Mongols are mentioned as rulers and have a relationship with the Uighurs.\n\n2. Step 2: We notice that the Mongols ranked the Uighurs higher than other groups, such as the Koreans and Karluks. This suggests that the Mongols' ranking of the Uighurs may be related to their conquest of Tibet. We also see that the Uighurs surrendered peacefully to the Mongols, which may have contributed to their higher ranking.\n\n3. Step 3: We examine the relationships between the Mongols and other groups to see if there are any patterns or explanations for why the Uighurs were ranked higher. We see that the Mongols placed the Uighurs over the Koreans, which further supports the idea that the Mongols", "em": 0, "f1": 0.0}
