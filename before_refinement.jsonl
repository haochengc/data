We know that César Boutteville was born in Thin-Hao, which is part of Hanoi's urban district Dong Da. Therefore, we need to find the capital of French Indochina before it was moved to Hanoi.\n\n2. Step 2: We examine the relationships in the knowledge graph and find that French Indochina had its capital moved from Saigon (now known as Ho Chi Minh City). This implies that before the capital was moved to Hanoi, it was located in Saigon.\n\n3. Step 3: We confirm that Saigon is indeed the city where the capital of French Indochina was located before it was moved to Hanoi. This is supported by relationship 5, which states that French Indochina had its capital moved from Saigon.\n\n4.

However, relationship 5 also states that French Indochina had its capital moved to Hanoi, which seems to be a repetition of relationship 3. We need to look for another relationship that provides the previous capital.\n\n3. Step 3: Upon reviewing the relationships again, we find that relationship 4 states that French Indochina had its capital moved to Da Lat, but this is not the correct answer because the question asks for the capital before it was moved to Hanoi, and Da Lat is not the correct city.
